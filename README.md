# Django-Learning
I am following tutorials on udemy and saving the tasks done while following the Django tutorials and also saving the solved challenges..


To run the app..create a directory of name "crudexample"
Take the pull.
run "python3 manage.py migrate"
run "python3 manage.py makemigrations"
run "python3 manage.py migrate"

if you get any error's solve it and then run "python3 manage.py runserver"...
and you can see the app running on "http://127.0.0.1/8000/show"
